This theme is a public WIP and more things will be added over time, read the TO-DO list to see what currently needs to be done/is being worked on.
This mainly changes the Dark logo (no plans for Rhythm Light Exceed yet), as well as the song select background formula, making song backgrounds visible at all times.
The theme is based off of the legacy default theme for SM5.
The changes in this fork are based on an older build of Rhythm Dark, so things may not fully work as intended.

# Features
Go into Theme Options and pick your Team! Dark, Light, or even Exceed? The appearance, sounds, and music will change based off of your selected team, including your mascot character.

# Warnings
This theme has only been tested on StepMania 5.1 beta 2, there is no guarantee it will work on other branches of SM5 including OutFox (however, Rhythm Exceed itself has been tested on Project Outfox).

DO NOT USE THIS THEME IN PUBLIC, THIS IS FOR PRIVATE USE ONLY.

# To-Do List
- Restore the original Rhythm Dark music select behaviour, and make the new changes part of an "Exceed" mode.
- Add a new Team: Team Exceed. This Team is based around the colors and the ocean, trying to discover everything there is about the water in order to harness some ultimate power for mass destruction. I don't fully know yet haha
